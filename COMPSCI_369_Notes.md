## Introduction to genetics

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

**Translation** is the process of converting DNA into mRNA.  
**Transcription** is the process of converting mRNA into proteins.

A **linear gap penalty** is defined as \(\gamma(k)=-dk\) where \(d>0\) and \(k\) is the gap length.  
An **affine gap penalty** is defined as \(\gamma(k)=-d-(k-1)e\) where \(d>e>0\) and \(k\) is the gap length. \(d\) is the gap open penalty and \(e\) is the gap extension penalty.
